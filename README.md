In this repository, I have uploaded some projects that I have learnt in Intel Workshop. That includes Artificial Neural Network in Project 1 and Project 2 and Convolutional Neural Network in Project 3 and Project 4. And in Project 5 and Project 6, we used Transfer Learning for Facemask Detection and Textile Defect Detection.
